### File-Based (Recommended)
1. Edit solution in: `solutions/YYYY/MM/<session_id>_solution.<ext>`
2. Run `submit` to evaluate from file

### Paste-Based (Fallback)

LC_SUBMISSION
Lang: python
Problem: LC-1 Two Sum
Code:
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # your solution
```

## Evaluation Output (LC_EVAL)
- Verdict: pass/fail/partial
- Complexity: time & space (actual + optimal)
- Failure points and edge cases
- Fixes if needed
- Test cases (4-6 focused)
- Hint level offered for next attempt

## Additional Commands
- `rate` - Detailed scoring (0-5): Correctness, Complexity, Robustness, Readability, Idiomatic Use
