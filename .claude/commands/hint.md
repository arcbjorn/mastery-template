Progressive hint ladder for getting unstuck during sessions.

## Hint Levels
- `hint 1` / `nudge` - Reframe invariant/constraint (1 sentence)
- `hint 2` - Strategy outline + key observation (no code)
- `hint 3` - Pseudocode or rough steps
- `blocked` / `struggling` - Auto-offers Level 1 hint
- `spoiler` - Full solution (only use when giving up)

## Usage
- Start with lower levels
- Progress only if still stuck
- Track hint usage for weak area identification

## Examples
- `hint 1` - Gentle nudge
- `hint 2` - Strategic guidance
- `blocked` - Immediate help
